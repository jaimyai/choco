        "body": "Dear Board Members, Please find attached the annual financial report for fiscal year 2023. The overall revenue increased by 12% compared to the previous year. Gross margin improved by 3 percentage points, reaching 45%. Operating expenses remained flat, resulting in a net profit increase of 15%. We have highlighted key growth drivers in section two of the report. Cash reserves are strong, and capital expenditures are within budget. The balance sheet remains healthy with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5. We recommend approval of the proposed dividend payout. Please review the report and share any comments by February 15th. Thank you for your continued support. Sincerely, Alex Johnson",
