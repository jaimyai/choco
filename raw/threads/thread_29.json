        "body": "Dear Client,\n\nThank you for your interest in our ERP services. We have conducted a thorough analysis of your current processes and identified key areas for improvement. Our proposal outlines a phased implementation plan that minimizes downtime and ensures seamless integration with your existing systems. The first phase focuses on requirement gathering and system design, which we estimate will take four weeks. In phase two, our team will handle development, configuration, and initial testing over a period of eight weeks. We will also provide comprehensive training sessions for your staff to facilitate user adoption. Upon completion, we anticipate improved reporting accuracy, streamlined workflows, and reduced operational costs. The total cost estimate for the project is detailed in the attached document. We are confident that our expertise and dedicated support team will deliver a successful implementation.\n\nSincerely,\nSophia",
